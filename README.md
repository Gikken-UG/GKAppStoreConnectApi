# GKAppStoreConnectApi
Programmatically create promo codes for your App Store Connect apps.

Log in to App Store Connect, fetch your teams and apps and request promo codes for them.

Our main use for this lib would be [Tokens 2](https://gikken.co/new-tokens)

Based on [ESSAppStoreConnectAPI](https://github.com/eternalstorms/ESSAppStoreConnectAPI), 
which is based on code taken from [fastlane](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane), both under the MIT license.

This is still work-in-progress, as it still lacks support for IAP promo codes and 2FA is untested, so it may not work.
